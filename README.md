# Project Title: Detecting AI-Generated Text Using Deep Learning Models

## Description

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to distinguish between essays written by students and those generated by large language models (LLMs). We participated in the Kaggle competition "LLM - Detect AI Generated Text" to apply various deep learning techniques for this task.

### What does the project do?

- **Dataset**: The project uses a dataset of essays written by students and LLMs. The key challenge is that the dataset is highly imbalanced, with very few AI-generated texts.
- **Data Preprocessing**: We preprocess the text data by removing unnecessary characters and tokenizing the essays, making them suitable for input into neural networks.
- **Models Used**: Several deep learning models were tested, including:
  - A **Feedforward Neural Network** that uses simple embeddings of tokenized text.
  - A fine-tuned **BERT Classifier**, a transformer-based model, for more advanced text classification.
  - A **Contrastive Neural Network**, designed to cluster similar data points closer in a latent space.
  - Multiple **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** to capture textual features.

### Final Results
After experimenting with these models, we achieved a validation accuracy of approximately 99% across different architectures. Our best submission on the Kaggle leaderboard achieved a competitive score, demonstrating the effectiveness of the deep learning techniques employed.

This project highlights the importance of data preprocessing, model selection, and the use of deep learning methods in solving text classification problems, specifically for detecting AI-generated content.
