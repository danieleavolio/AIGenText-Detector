The other evidence for the canonical existence of Kaguya in the One Piece story is Pandaman. Yes, Pandaman. Pandaman is kind of a meme Oda puts here and there.

Izanagi had three children, you definitely have heard their names before. Amaterasu, the Sun deity. Tsukuyomi, the Moon deity. And Susanoo, the Deity of (Storms and) the Sea. It is said that Amaterasu was born when Izanagi washed his left eye, Tsukuyomi was born when he washed his right one and Susanoo when he washed his nose. Luffy, who is ate the mythical devil fruit based on a Sun deity (Nika) could be Amaterasu (duh). Blackbeard, who has been depicted with a moon by his side and literally controls the darkness with his devil fruit powers could resemble Tsukuyomi. And Imu, which might be an inversion of \"Umi\" the Japanese word for \"sea\" or \"ocean\" could be Oda's version of Susanoo.\"\"\"\n",
